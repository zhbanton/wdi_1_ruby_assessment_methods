#### Question 1

def square(x)
  x * x
end

y = square(2)
# What is the value of 'x' after this line executes?


#### Question 2

def get_older(age)
  age = age + 1
end

age = 10
get_older(age)


#### Question 3
# What is the return value of `jump` when called on the last line here?

def how_high
  energy * energy
end

def jump
  height = how_high()
  height - 2
end

energy = 2
jump


#### Question 4
# Write a method that accepts a string and an optional multiplier (defaults to 3)

# Do not use an options hash or keyword arguments.


#### Question 5

  greeting = "#{salutation} there, #{name}"
  volume == :high ? greeting.upcase : greeting
end
